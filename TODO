- Consider a 'failsafe' DataSource
  If all others fail, setting a default that
   - sets the user password, writing it to console
   - logs to console that this happened
- Consider 'previous' DataSource
  If no other data source is found, fall back to the 'previous' one
  keep a indication of what instance id that is in /var/lib/cloud
- Rewrite "cloud-init-query" (currently not implemented)
  Possibly have DataSource and cloudinit expose explicit fields
   - instance-id
   - hostname
   - mirror
   - release
   - ssh public keys
- Remove the conversion of the ubuntu network interface format conversion
  to a RH/fedora format and replace it with a top level format that uses
  the netcf libraries format instead (which itself knows how to translate
  into the specific formats)
- Replace the 'apt*' modules with variants that now use the distro classes
  to perform distro independent packaging commands (where possible)
