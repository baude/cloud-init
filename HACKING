To get changes into cloud-init, the process to follow is:

 *  get your changes into a local bzr branch:
    # init a repo, and checkout trunk (init repo is to share bzr info
    # across multiple checkouts, its different than git).
    bzr init-repo cloud-init
    bzr branch lp:cloud-init trunk.dist
    bzr branch trunk.dist my-topic-branch
 * commit your changes
    bzr commit
    # note, you can make multiple commits, fixes, more commits.
 * check pylint and pep8 and test , and address issues
    make test pylint pep8
 * push to launchpad to a personal branch:
    bzr push lp:~<YOUR_USERNAME>/cloud-init/<BRANCH_NAME>
 * propose that for a merge into lp:cloud-init via web browser
    # open the branch in launchpad, it will be at:
    # https://code.launchpad.net/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<PROJECT>/<BRANCH_NAME>
    # for example:
    # https://code.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/mybranch
    click 'propose for merging'
    select 'lp:cloud-init' as the target branch

 Then, someone on cloud-init-dev (currently Scott Moser and Joshua Harlow) will
review your changes and follow up in the merge request.

 Feel free to ping #cloud-init on freenode if you have any questions.
