=== Overview ===
Vendordata is data provided by the entity that launches an instance.
The cloud provider makes this data available to the instance via in one
way or another.

Vendordata follows the same rules as user-data, with the following
caveauts:
    1. Users have ultimate control over vendordata
    2. By default it only runs on first boot
    3. Vendordata runs at the users pleasure. If the use of
        vendordata is required for the instance to run, then
        vendordata should not be used.
    4. Most vendor operations should be done either via script,
        boot_hook or upstart job.

Vendors utilizing the vendordata channel are strongly advised to
use the #cloud-config-jsonp method, otherwise they risk that a
user can accidently override choices.

Further, we strongly advise vendors to not 'be evil'. By evil, we
mean any action that could compromise a system. Since users trust
you, please take care to make sure that any vendordata is safe,
atomic, idempotent and does not put your users at risk.

cloud-init can read this input and act on it in different ways.

=== Input Formats ===
cloud-init will download and cache to filesystem any vendor-data that it
finds.  However, certain types of vendor-data are handled specially.

 * Gzip Compressed Content
   content found to be gzip compressed will be uncompressed, and
   these rules applied to the uncompressed data

 * Mime Multi Part archive
   This list of rules is applied to each part of this multi-part file
   Using a mime-multi part file, the user can specify more than one
   type of data.  For example, both a user data script and a
   cloud-config type could be specified.

 * vendor-data Script
   begins with: #!            or Content-Type: text/x-shellscript
   script will be executed at "rc.local-like" level during first boot.
   rc.local-like means "very late in the boot sequence"

 * Include File
   begins with  #include      or Content-Type: text/x-include-url
   This content is a "include" file.  The file contains a list of
   urls, one per line.  Each of the URLs will be read, and their content
   will be passed through this same set of rules.  Ie, the content
   read from the URL can be gzipped, mime-multi-part, or plain text

* Include File Once
   begins with  #include-once      or Content-Type: text/x-include-once-url
   This content is a "include" file.  The file contains a list of
   urls, one per line.  Each of the URLs will be read, and their content
   will be passed through this same set of rules.  Ie, the content
   read from the URL can be gzipped, mime-multi-part, or plain text
   This file will just be downloaded only once per instance, and its
   contents cached for subsequent boots.  This allows you to pass in
   one-time-use or expiring URLs.

 * Cloud Config Data
   begins with  #cloud-config or Content-Type: text/cloud-config

   This content is "cloud-config" data.  See the examples for a
   commented example of supported config formats.

 * Upstart Job
   begins with  #upstart-job  or Content-Type: text/upstart-job

   Content is placed into a file in /etc/init, and will be consumed
   by upstart as any other upstart job.

 * Cloud Boothook
   begins with #cloud-boothook or Content-Type: text/cloud-boothook

   This content is "boothook" data.  It is stored in a file under
   /var/lib/cloud and then executed immediately.

   This is the earliest "hook" available.  Note, that there is no
   mechanism provided for running only once.  The boothook must take
   care of this itself.  It is provided with the instance id in the
   environment variable "INSTANCE_ID".  This could be made use of to
   provide a 'once-per-instance'

=== Examples ===
There are examples in the examples subdirectory.
Additionally, the 'tools' directory contains 'write-mime-multipart',
which can be used to easily generate mime-multi-part files from a list
of input files.  That data can then be given to an instance.

See 'write-mime-multipart --help' for usage.
